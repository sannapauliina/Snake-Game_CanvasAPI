# Snake Game

This project is a classic oldschool Snake Game, built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.  
It runs directly in the browser without any external libraries or installations.  
The goal is simple: guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself.  

**Implementation:**
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript for game logic and controls
- Lightweight and easy to extend

**How to Play:**
- Control the snake with the arrow keys
- Eat the red food to grow and score points
- The game ends if you hit the wall or your own tail
